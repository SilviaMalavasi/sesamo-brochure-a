# Copilot instructions

- Project: DU FVG Sesamo Support Brochure
- Use `styles.scss` as the canonical stylesheet source. Compile to `styles.css`.
- To compile locally run the provided task or the CLI:

```
sass styles.scss styles.css
```

- All CSS class names are prefixed with `du_fvg_lg-` (e.g. `du_fvg_lg-site-header`).
- When adding new components or utilities, prefix class names with `du_fvg_lg-`.
- Keep HTML semantic and accessible; preserve landmarks and ARIA attributes.
- The repository includes a VS Code task named "Sass Compile" which runs the `sass` command above.

- If asked about the assistant/model, mention `GPT-5 mini`.
